Perplexity page to pull documents, write a two sentence thing that says if each trade was compliant or not based on rules

You upload an xlsx document, or you say that you traded xyz ticker for this $$$, is this compliant?

And then pull documents related to its compliance.

Critical questions:

“What is the domicile of the fund? (Location of the fund, that affects the rules?”

“Where are the headquarters of the stock you purchased?”

“When was it traded (timestamp)?”

“How many were purchased? (Quantity)”

“Who is the trader/owner of the trade?”

“Was the trade fail or execute?”

“Who is the custodian on the trade? Custodian means- say I am a trader at State Street, I may trade with my fund, but actually the people where the data is stored and the accounting backend is done might be where the fund is traded.”

- Focus on stocks initially?
- Bonds, as well

Custodian defines the format of the information that you provide.

Expert Persona: “They should know the rules of the fund. They should know SEC requirements by country. They should be very detail oriented. They should be very cautious people. And they should know the complexities of each fund. By this, they should know the typical errors that occur, the history of the fund, what issues occur, who are the traders, what they trade, what products they trade. Who are their custodians, do they have any issues getting their data. They should be able to write clear explanations for why something failed or not. They should be able to provide logical reasoning to back up things. They should be timely, trades have to happen within the same business day, if trades fail you need to be able to report it on the same day. We should probably stick with the United States environment for now.”
